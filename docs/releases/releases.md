## 🎯 CANFAR Releases

The CADC team is releasing the CANFAR Science Platform (CanfarSP) on a fixed, predictable schedule.  This is to allow deployers to build into their schedules the rollout of new versions of CanfarSP.

CanfarSP releases are named using the year and number, in the form **CanfarSP <year>.<number>**.  For example, the first release of 2025 was named **CanfarSP 2025.1**.

We currently aiming for a CanfarSP release every 3 months.

In the subpages of this section of documentation, detailed notes about each release can be found.

CanfarSP releases include a time of dedicated integration and regression testing, and internal user testing.  Generally:

- New features can only be added to CanfarSP in a fixed cycle release
- Bug fixes are added to CanfarSP immediately and result in a patch release
- Collaborators can get access to new features prior to their target release, but only as experimental software because the features have not been thoroughly tested.

### Roadmap

Currently, the CanfarSP Roadmap is managed interally by CADC, though we plan on making it public in the near future.  For questions or suggestions about the CanfarSP Roadmap, please reach out to the CADC team.
